The name `996.ICU` refers to **"Work by '996', sick in ICU"**, an ironic saying among Chinese developers, which means that by following the "996" work schedule, you are risking yourself getting into the ICU (Intensive Care Unit).

What is 996?
---

A "996" work schedule refers to an unofficial work schedule (9 a.m.&ndash;9 p.m., 6 days per week) that has been gaining popularity. Serving a company that encourages the "996" work schedule usually means working for at least 60 hours per week.

### State Media
- [The 996 shall disappear](http://www.xinhuanet.com/politics/2019-04/15/c_1124370790.htm)


### Capitalists
- **Jack Ma, founder of Alibaba**: `It is a huge blessing to be able to '996'`.
- **Richard Liu, founder of JD.com**: `We will never force our employee to work as '996'`.
(However, as a result many anonymous employees claim that there is a **list** of departments which **ranked** them by overtime hours. The shortest will take punishments. And the leaders never leave evidences when asking employees to work as '996'.)
- **Bai Ya, founder of Youzan**: `This will definitely be a right decision when we look back in a few years.`

### Developers
- **Guido van Rossum, founder of Python**: [`The '996' working schedule is inhumane.`](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=wordseach.puzzlegame.nova

Principles and purposes
---

* 996.ICU is an initiative initiated by IT practitioners. We welcome people from other fields and other countries to join the discussion.

* This is not a political movement. We firmly uphold the labor law and request employers to respect the legitimate rights and interests of their employees.

* It is great progress from closed source to open source, and it will also be great progress from open source to emphasizing labor rights at the same time. What we want is to create an open source software license that advocates workers' rights.

* We are willing to hear all positive and constructive proposals and advocate mature and responsible speech.

Even with interaction limits on, the issues area was totally out of control.
So I **personally** decided to switch it off, not by GitHub or others.
